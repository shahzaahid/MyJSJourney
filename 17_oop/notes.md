## OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing computer programs that organizes and structures code around the concept of "objects.

### Way of styling the code.

- procedure programming

- OOP programming

### object

- collection of properties and methods

### why use OOP

- Mess up code .

### parts of OOP

- Object literal

- constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 Pillars

1. **Abstraction:**

   - Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share, while hiding unnecessary details.

2. **Encapsulation:**

   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class, preventing direct access to the internal details from outside the class.

3. **Inheritance:**

   - Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass), promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchy of classes.

4. **Polymorphism:**
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of a common type, enabling flexibility and extensibility in code by providing a way to use a single interface for different data types or classes.
