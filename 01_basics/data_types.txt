JavaScript has several built-in data types, which can be categorized into two main categories: primitive data types and reference data types. Here's an overview of each:

1. **Primitive Data Types:**
   These data types represent single values and are immutable (cannot be changed once they are created). They are compared by their actual value.

   - **Number**: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers. For example: `let age = 25;`

   - **String**: Represents textual data. For example: `let name = "John";`

   - **Boolean**: Represents a true or false value. For example: `let isStudent = true;`

   - **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. For example: `let x;`

   - **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value or a variable with no value. For example: `let y = null;`

   - **Symbol**: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), symbols are unique and immutable values, often used as object property keys. For example: `const uniqueID = Symbol('id');`

   - **BigInt**: Introduced in ECMAScript 11 (ES11), BigInt is used for working with large integers that cannot be represented by the `Number` data type. For example: `const bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;`

2. **Reference Data Types:**
   These data types are more complex and can hold multiple values. They are mutable (their contents can change) and are compared by reference (whether they refer to the same object in memory).

   - **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be of any data type. Objects can represent various data structures, such as arrays, functions, and custom data structures.

   - **Array**: A special type of object used to store ordered lists of values. Elements in an array can be of any data type.

   - **Function**: A callable object that can be executed when invoked. Functions are a fundamental part of JavaScript and can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.

   - **Date**: Represents dates and times.

   - **RegExp**: Represents regular expressions for pattern matching and manipulation of strings.

   - **Map**: A collection of key-value pairs that can use any data type as keys.

   - **Set**: A collection of unique values, where each value can occur only once.

   - **and more...**: JavaScript also has other reference data types like `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`, `Promise`, and various other objects and classes introduced by libraries and frameworks.

It's important to understand these data types because JavaScript's dynamic typing allows you to use them interchangeably in many cases, but it's essential to know their characteristics and use them appropriately to avoid unexpected behavior in your code.
